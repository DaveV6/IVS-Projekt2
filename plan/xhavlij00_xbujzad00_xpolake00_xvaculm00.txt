Communication:
	- For communication about work on the project we chose Discord, where we created separate server used only for this project
	- Within the server, the structure is divided into channels for better clarity
	- In case of technical difficulties with Discord, we transfer to platform Slack, in case of emergency messenger
	- In case of complete technical failure + communication in urgent cases - phone + personal meetings

Communication rules:
	- Discord server is used ONLY for communication about project
	- Use channels only for specified topics
	- In case of technical failure, notify all members of the team

Version control system:
	- GitHub private repository
	- On GitHub we created Project for better clarity and management of the development
	- https://github.com/DaveV6/IVS-Projekt2
	- Permission to control, evaluate the repository was given to email ivs.kontrola@gmail.com
